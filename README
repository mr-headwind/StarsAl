 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
    MYPROJECT (Astronomy CCD in Telescope Capture) is an application designed for 
    video and image capture of the Planets and the Moon. A suitable astronomy or
    modified webcam will give the best results, however it will work with most webcams.
    The camera driver must be V4L2 compliant.

    Numerous video and image formats are available, however FITS image support is
    mostly basic and should only be used by those familiar with it.

    MYPROJECT is intended for use with Linux only.

    While MYPROJECT is primarily designed for use in astronomy, it can also serve as a general
    webcam program.

 INSTALL
 -------
    There are several ways to install MYPROJECT outlined below.

 1. DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
 -----------------------
    This is the preferred method for installation.

    Download the latest distribution archive from here: 
    	https://github.com/mr-headwind/MYPROJECT/tree/master/DIST_PACKAGES 
    to your download directory (eg. $HOME/Downloads).

    Start a terminal or xterm session
    cd $HOME/Downloads (or your download directory)
    tar xvzf MYPROJECT-x.xx.tar.gz (where x.xx is the version number)
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install

    There are a number of package dependencies (see below) that will be highlighted
    during the configure process. These must be installed.

 2. DEB PACKAGE
 --------------
    A binary deb package file is available on SourceForge at:-

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/MYPROJECT/?source=directory

    or go to the SourceForge home page and search for MYPROJECT.

    It has been a little difficult to test this package properly so it is provided
    as is only. If you experience any problem with it, please let me know (see BUGS ... below).

 3. BUILD FROM SOURCE
 --------------------
    If you wish to build and/or work on MYPROJECT separately, the git repository is located at:

    	https://github.com/mr-headwind/MYPROJECT

    Either clone the repository or download the repository package to a suitable development 
    directory (eg. $HOME/Development/MYPROJECT). You may also download individual files and there 
    is a RELEASES directory with various stable snapshot archives.
    If you elect to grab individual files be warned that these may be in a work-in-progress
    state and be unstable.
    	
    The icon image file 'MYPROJECT.png' will need to be located appropriately:
    	cd $HOME
    	mkdir -P .local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps
    	mkdir -P .local/share/pixmaps/MYPROJECT
    	cd MYPROJECT (or whatever directory was chosen for download)
    	ln -s MYPROJECT.png .local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/MYPROJECT.png
    	ln -s MYPROJECT.png .local/share/pixmaps/MYPROJECT/MYPROJECT.png

    If you wish to make your own distribution package the 'setup_AutoTools.sh' shell script 
    in the AutoTools directory will set up a release structure, but may need to be altered 
    if your directory structure is different.

 DEPENDENCIES
 ------------
    The GTK+ 3.0 and xxxx libraries need to be installed and, for the most part,
    will likely already be present. However, if there is a problem, try:
    	sudo apt-get install xxxx 
    	sudo apt-get build-dep libgtk-3-dev 
	sudo apt-get update

 THINGS TO BE DONE
